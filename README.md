### Built with

- React Components
- React Fragments
- React Portals
- React Refs

### What I learned

- React Fragments allow to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM;
- Portals can be used to render an element outside of its parent component's DOM node 
while preserving its position in the React hierarchy.
- useRef() is a hook that allows to directly create a reference to the DOM element in the functional component.  

### Continued development

- Practice React Portals and React Refs in the future projects;

### Useful resources
